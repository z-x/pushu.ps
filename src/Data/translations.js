		<h2>How to start?</h2>
		<p>You just need to do the initial test to tell the app on what level are you. Then you need to take a day of rest. After that the app will provide you with a set of pushups to do. I recomend you do this three days a week and <strong>after each set you should take a day of rest</strong>. Monday, Wednesday and Friday for example.</p>
		<p>It may be hard at the begining, so don’t give up easily. It gets better down the road.</p>
		<h2>I barely can do a single pushup</h2>
		<p>If you feel your muscles are too weak you might consider training with knee push ups. This will give you time to build some muscle. When you’ll find you are ready, you can reset the app and start all over with full push up.</p>
		<h2>Is this a professional workout?</h2>
		<p>I am no professional trainer and this is just a simple training for simple people that I found useful to maintain a good form.</p>
		<h2>How to do a good push up?</h2>
		<p>You can easily find a guidance on YouTube. :)</p>
		<p>What I found particullary useful is to equip yourself with a set of push up handles/bars. Later on when there are a lot of push ups to do my wrists were hurt. Buying the cheapest handles fixed that.</p>

		</div>
		<p>If you feel you will have tough time doing full push ups you can always make it a little easier by resting on your knees.</p>

		</div>
		<h2>Is there a goal here?</h2>
		<p>You set the goal. The app will ask you if the proposed set of pushups was hard or easy to make. If you answer it was hard, it will let you do the same set untill it gets easier. Then it will propose another set with more push ups to make.</p>
		<p>You can continue as long as you can or choose to stop at any level and just repeat a single set to maintain your level.</p>
		<p>I also like to start from the begining from time to time by resetting the app and build my way up from the first level all over.</p>
		<h2>How you use this app?</h2>
		<p>I recommend that you open this app on your phone as it is easier to take with you wherever you will do the workout.</p>
		<p>You can install the app by adding this website to your Home Screen.</p>
		<p>For Apple users this is the only way for the app to remember your progress. Apple devices tend to remove the saved data after a week of not using any website and the only way to prevent this is by adding it to Home Screen.</p>
		<p>Android users can add this website to their Home Screen as well to be able to use it as a normal system application.</p>

		<h2>I do:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Collect the data about how you are using the app.</li>
			<li>Collect the data about your progress and your level.</li>
			<li>Collect the data about the browser and the device you are using with help of Google Analytics, please refer to their <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for the detailed information about what data is being collected.</li>
			<li>Save the data on this device (information about your settings and your progress) using localStorage API.</li>

		<h2>Why?</h2>
		<p>I collect the data so I could improve the app in future. For example by implementing machine learning algorithm that could prepare personalised trainings instead predefined ones.</p>
		<p>I also collect the data to know if anyone is really using the app. :)</p>
